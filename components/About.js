                    So, the guide is simple. You just search song by its name in Spotify and then can choose from relevant songs. 
                    Then you press on plus icon and your song goes to «Your new Spotify playlist» where you can give a name to playlist, 
                    delete songs and save playlist to Spotify profile by pressing «Save new playlist» button. That’s it for now.

                    In general, this is an educational project that I made for Codecademy.com course. I used vanilla JavaScript, React, Next.js, Git.
                    Maybe later I’ll implement some new things but now you can check out project’s GitHub repository.
