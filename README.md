# Spotiful
## Introduction
This pet project is a portfolio assignment of the Front-End Engineer Career Path course (Codecademy.com).
## Features and limitations
### Key Features
Using the application, a user with a **Spotify** account can:
  - Search tracks on Spotify;
  - Add tracks to a custom playlist;
  - Customize the playlist's Name, Description and Privacy settings;
  - Add new custom playlists to Spotify account;
### Possible restrictions
Since Spotify access tokens are used to send GET/POST requests, authorization or registration is required (for new Spotify users). This **may not be possible for users from Russia**, however you can use **VPN**.
## Technologies used
  - Next.js, JavaScript;
  - Sass, Figma;
  - React Hook Form, Fetch API, Next.js routing.
## Issues and plans
Now I'm trying to make a static build without any issues (due to .css files returning).<br />
In the list of project branches you can see:
 - **main** branch (with dev files);
 - **build** branch (with files generated by `next build`);
 - **gh-pages** branch (with files generated by `next export` to create static deploying files).
     - This branch has the issue with .css.
